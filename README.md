Typelevel programming allows developers to encode several flavours of runtime invariants into the type system. Unfortunately, 
libraries that support typelevel programming tend to be poorly documented, difficult to understand and difficult to hack. This makes
them hard to customize to the needs of a specific project/problem. 

Building on a series of tutorials published on [apocalisp](https://apocalisp.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/type-level-programming-in-scala/)
and several other online resources, typefoo provides concise, efficient and easy-to-modify implementations of several typelevel programming primitives. As such, 
it represents collected wisdom on type-hackery in scala.
